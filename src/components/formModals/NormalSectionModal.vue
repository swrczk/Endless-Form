            In this section, create the questions according to the player's level. The more stars, the more difficult the question should be. However,
            if it turns out that the question is not suitable for the students at a given level, then we will change it, and you will receive
            information about it in the Final Report. <br />
            Remember that the student has to answer only the obligatory questions. How many questions in this section will be answered is completely
            up to them. <br />
            Questions marked as Important will have more value in the game. If the student keeps playing long enough he will answer all of them.
            Unmarked questions will be randomly selected between them. <br />
            If during the game, the student changes the level of knowledge, then the rest of the questions will be asked from a different level in an
            appropriate amount. If the student does not change his difficulty level, he will answer all the Important questions and part of other
            questions.
